> Apply pending tasks at end of battle
	- Needs testing. Had to create a distinction between mandatory (temporary) tasks and other ones. The former *only* need
	  to be applied at the end. For example, if you had strength-1 during a battle, you'd need to restore that at the end. OTOH
	  if there was a task to kill a characterm in 3 turns (FF Doom style) then you wouldn't want to apply that.
o Status icons in HUD?
	- need to make the panel showing HP switchable, right trigger to cycle panels?
o Defend action - puts player into "defend" pose for one turn, increases physical defence by +N
o Extended 'boost' functionality
	- Gesture recognition
o More monsters
o Monster types (land / water / reptile / dragon / avian / humanoid)
o Monster attack groups
o More boost types
o Merge of Anim blueprints to save hassle of per-character rigging
	- May not be possible universally due to skeleton constraints
o More items
o Item customisation / combination
o More actions
o More fx
o Prop-based development. Combine key items in multiple ways to acquire different skills.
o Skill affinities: each character can wield any skill, only one can do it it better.
o "Delay" ability that stalls an action (eg heal) for a turn so that you can repair after an anticipated hit.
o Cooperative spells
o Spell sequences
o "Solar panel" - gain energy as you walk
o Better music track
o Resource management
	- Review
o Improve ring menu gfx
o Analog control to move selectors
o Projected textures for cloud shadows
o Merge of battle tasks and turn schedule
	- Not sure. Tasks are heap-based so only the top item is valid. Turns need the ordered look-ahead to draw the UI.
