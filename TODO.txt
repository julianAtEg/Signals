o Improve ring menu gfx
o Analog control to move selectors

DONE:
26/07/16 Apply pending tasks at end of battle
	- Needs testing. Had to create a distinction between mandatory (temporary) tasks and other ones. The former *only* need
	  to be applied at the end. For example, if you had strength-1 during a battle, you'd need to restore that at the end. OTOH
	  if there was a task to kill a character in 3 turns (FF Doom style) then you wouldn't want to apply that.
